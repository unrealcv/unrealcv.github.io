title: UnrealCV - CVPR 17 Demo
---

Welcome to the CVPR17 demo page of UnrealCV. This page contains what you saw in our demo station. Our demo time is **07/22 Morning 10:30 - 12:30** and **Afternoon 15:00 - 17:00**. Please share this link with your friends if you like our demo.

Our demo includes two parts, [pre-recorded videos](#video) and [live-demo](#demo)

## Video

The first video demonstrates **various applications of UnrealCV**, including: 

- Object mask generation in a virtual supermarket,  
- Bounding box generation and running a detection algorithm in a virtual scene, 
- Controlling hazardous factors to diagnose the robustness of stereo depth estimation algorithms, 
- Indoor navigation and object interaction.

The second video includes **various 3D scenes** that can be used in UnrealCV, including: 

- A static virtual scene, RealisticRendering, 
- A dynamic virtual scene, Matinee, 
- A virtual supermarket in which grocery items are randomly placed for training, 
- More virtual scenes that have been used in the research

## Live demo

- Faster-RCNN detection demo

    Move a virtual camera in a virtual room, see how well the detection algorithm works. Also demonstrate the ground truth that can be produced by a virtual scene using UnrealCV.

    You can reproduce this demo with two simple steps

    1. Download the RealisticRendering virtual scene from our model zoo http://unrealcv.org/model_zoo
    2. Follow the tutorial in this page http://docs.unrealcv.org/en/master/tutorials/faster_rcnn.html


- Virtual supermarket demo

- A virtual toy-robotics arm
