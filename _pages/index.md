UnrealCV is a project to help computer vision researchers build virtual worlds using Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). It extends UE4 with a plugin by providing:

1. A set of UnrealCV commands to interact with the virtual world.
2. Communication between UE4 and an external program, such as Caffe.

UnrealCV can be used in two ways. The first one is using a compiled game binary with UnrealCV embedded. This is as simple as running a game, no knowledge of Unreal Engine is required. The second is installing UnrealCV plugin to Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and use the editor of UE4 to build a new virtual world.

Please read [Tutorial: Getting Started](http://docs.unrealcv.org/en/master/tutorials/getting_started.html) to learn using UnrealCV.
